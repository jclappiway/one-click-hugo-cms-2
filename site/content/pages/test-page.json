He was an expert in fabrics and wanted to offer women upmarket elegant fashion to create feminine allure. By 1990, Promod was a major fashion retailer in Europe and opened the first Saudi Arabian store in 1999, going on to expand further in the Middle East. Also in 1999, Promod launched its first online shop as a pioneer in the fashion market. In 2006, the brand was introduced in Asia and, in 2013, we opened in America and the United Kingdom. \r\n\n\r\n\nToday, the Promod brand promotes accessible fashion clothing, in unpretentious natural styles, creating a French fashion spirit in more than 40 countries. \n\n\n\n## OUR VALUES\n\n> strong style - personality - coordination\r\n>\n> \\\n>\n>\n> feeling great - being natural\n\nAt Promod, we strive to create fashion that you want to wear!
